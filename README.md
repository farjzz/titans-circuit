# Titan's Circuit

**Titanâ€™s Circuit** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game built with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**
Players compete by placing and moving Titans across a concentric hexagonal grid to capture weighted edges, score points, and outwit their opponent within strict time limits.

## Objective
Control edges of the hexagonal board by placing and moving your Titans.  
The player with the **highest score** at the end of the game wins.

## Gameplay

- The board has **three concentric hexagonal circuits**  
- Each player (Red and Blue) has **4 Titans** to place
- Each edge has a weight. Owning both ends of an edge adds score equal to the weight of the edge to the player
- During their turn, the player can either place a new titan (if available) or move an existing titan to another node connected by an edge
- Unless the outer circuit is completely filled, the circuits inside it are blocked (movement/placement of titans isn't allowed)
- The game ends if the overall timer ends or the innermost circuit is fully occupied
